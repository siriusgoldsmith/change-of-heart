**CHANGE OF HEART** is a modern, standalone save editor and binary reverse-engineering studio for **Persona 5 Royal (PC / Steam)**. Built with a full **Phantom Thieves** visual interface, automatic Steam save detection, mathematical bitfield manipulation, and dual-layer CRC32 cryptographic re-signing.

> [!NOTE]
> ⚡ **100% Pure Vibecoded**: This entire application — from the AES-256 binary cryptography and multi-save oracle diffing to the standalone desktop UI and test suite — was built and reverse-engineered collaboratively via AI-driven pair programming sessions between **j0nnyDiGITAL**, **Hermes Agent**, and **Antigravity**.

---

## 📜 The Origin Story & Reverse-Engineering Journey

For years, the PC Steam version of *Persona 5 Royal* lacked a complete, open-source save editor. While basic cheat tables existed for live memory in Cheat Engine, the encrypted binary `.DAT` save format on PC had several unmapped "black box" regions that caused previous community tools to corrupt saves or fail silently.

This project was built across intensive collaborative AI-assisted reverse-engineering sessions:

### Phase 1: Cryptographic Pipeline & Core Memory Mapping (Hermes Agent)
- **Container Decryption & CRC Integrity:** Reverse-engineered Atlus's custom container wrapping, implementing textbook AES-256-CBC decryption alongside dual-layer CRC32 checksum calculation for both the header (`0x00000000`) and data payload (`0x00000020`).
- **Confidant & Social Structs:** Mapped the 16-byte fixed stride at `0x136A0` (`[6 pad][u16 ID][u16 Rank][u16 Points][4 pad]`), uncovering the story-gating point thresholds and romance bitfields.
- **The Dual-Pane Inventory Engine:** Decoded the 298-item master inventory table at `0x13000` spanning all 8 item categories (Melee, Guns, Armor, Accessories, Consumables, Tools, Skill Cards, and Treasure).

### Phase 2: The Compendium Breakthrough (Hermes & Antigravity)
- **The "Unsolvable" Compendium Blob:** Previous modding guides assumed the compendium was stored at `0x20000` (legacy PS4 format) or that it tracked owned stock.
- **Multi-Save Oracle Diffing:** Hermes Agent established a mathematical lattice across 7 independent save files spanning different dates (Early June → December → NG++ February). 
- **The 232-Bit LSB Discovery:** Just before an API connection dropout, Hermes isolated candidate bits at `0x09973`. Antigravity resumed the session, writing `compendium_verify.py` and proving the 5 mathematical proofs:
  1. *Strict Monotonic Growth:* Registrations strictly increased with gameplay ($33 \to 201 \to 217 \to 224$ set bits).
  2. *Party Persona Exclusion:* Party members (*Goemon, Johanna, Milady, etc.*) were naturally absent from the mask because they cannot be registered at the Velvet Room.
  3. *Held $\neq$ Registered:* Stock personas held in inventory but never registered at the Velvet Room did not have their bits set.
  4. *The Synchronized Mirror:* Discovered that the game maintains an authoritative primary mask at `0x09973` and a mirror copy at `0x21E83` (`+0x18510` offset) that must both be synced.

### Phase 3: Desktop Standalone & UI Polish
- Wrapped the entire application in a high-performance, single-executable desktop window (native PyWebView / Edge WebView2 engine hosting a stdlib HTTP backend).
- Integrated official 232-Persona high-res character artwork, instant search filters, and 1-click rescue guardrails.

## 📋 Changelog

### v1.1.1 (upcoming) — Security Audit & Robustness Fixes
> External full-project audit: every finding fixed.

- **🔒 CSRF Hardening:** The local API now validates browser `Origin` headers (loopback only); foreign origins get `403`. Replaced wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with validated reflection — malicious web pages can no longer drive the local save API while the editor runs.
- **🧰 Fresh-Clone Reproducibility:** `scripts/roundtrip_harness.py` and the `lint:context` shim (`tools/lint_context.js`) are now tracked — the test suite and lint gate no longer break on a fresh clone.
- **🕵️ Privacy:** Username/Steam-ID paths removed from tracked tests (glob-based Steam save discovery + `P5R_ORACLE_DIR` env override).
- **📦 Dependencies:** Dropped unused `bottle`; added `psutil`. Root legacy `HANDOFF.md` archived.

### v1.1.0 — Party Evolutions, Romance Toggle & Save Discovery Hotfix
- **⚡ Persona Evolution Tiers (1–3)** selector for all party members (Base/Awakened/Royal forms).
- **💖 Romance / Friendship route toggle** for Rank 9+ confidants on PC saves (`0x136A0` bit `0x02`).
- **🔄 Level ↔ EXP auto-sync** using the authentic Atlus cubic curve — prevents post-battle EXP stalls after level edits.
- **🔧 Fixed Haru (Slot 6) / Futaba (Slot 7) party swap.**
- **📂 Multi-location save auto-discovery** (Steam Userdata / LocalAppData / GamePass paths) + manual `📂 BROWSE...` file picker.
- **🔑 Key Items unlockable** via the Cheat Shop catalog (confirm-gated).
- **🖥️ WebView2 bundling hotfix:** EXE rebuilt on Python 3.14.6 + PyInstaller 6.22.0 embedding the full `pywebview` runtime — fixes browser-fallback regression.

### v1.0.10 — Compendium 100% Unlock Fix (Genuine-Save Parity)
> *"Why does it say 96%?"* — fixed, and proven in-game.

- **🐛 The 96% Compendium Bug — Root-Caused & Fixed:** Unlock ALL previously staged a *filtered* persona list; on save, unlisted personas (party Personas, Satanael variants, etc.) had their registration bits **actively cleared** and their Velvet Room records never written. The game's `Completed %` counts Velvet Room **records** (~232 denominator), not the mask — so partial records = 96%.
- **✅ Genuine-Save Parity:** Unlock ALL now triggers the verified backend full unlock: all **224 live registration bits** (party & Satanael bits included — genuine 100% saves set them too) plus all **232 Velvet Room records**, byte-equivalent to a real 100% NG+ save.
- **🧪 157/157 Unit Tests** including 4 new wiring regression tests (`TestCompendiumUnlockAllWiring`).
- **🎮 Verified In-Game** on two independent saves (one surgically repaired, one via the new Unlock ALL flow): both show **Completed 100%**, no greyed Satanael ghost.

### v1.0.9 — In-Game Parity, Master Inventory Overhaul & Full Compendium
- **🗃️ 10-Category Master Inventory:** unique equipment tracked by ownership flags (Melee `0x1B30`, Ranged `0x3430` — all 106 guns mapped, Outfits `0x3230` — all 286 costumes), stackables by count arrays (Armor/Accessories/Consumables/Skill Cards/Tools/Treasure), zero phantom items, engine mirror sync.
- **🖋️ Full-Spectrum Name Editor:** dual UTF-8 + Atlus font-glyph encoding across 8 primary/mirror blocks — names stick in dialogue, status screens, and calling cards.
- **🃏 Clean 100% Compendium:** Satanael ghost bug fixed (`0xD3` mask-only); authentic 232-record structure.
- **🛡️ Guarded Key Items** + dynamic asset packaging. See `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.9.md`.

### v1.0.8 — In-Game Parity Fixes: Names, Master Items & Compendium
- **🔤 Names** serialize into the in-game dialogue payload (`0x13840` family + mirrors), not just the header preview.
- **🎒 Item quantities** write to the authoritative master count array (`0x2410..0x2800` sub-bases) — no more 30-slot cap silently dropping items.
- **📖 Compendium math** corrected to the true 224-registerable denominator. See `patch_notes_v1.0.8.md`.

### v1.0.7 — Item Studio Rework: In-Game Inventory Behavior
> *"How would a real human want to use this?"*

- **🎒 In-Game Inventory View (Breaking Change):** The item list now shows **only items you actually carry**, matching P5R's real bag screen behavior. No more cluttered `✕ 0` entries for every unowned item in the database.
- **➕ Add Item Modal:** Click the new `+ ADD ITEM` button to open a searchable catalog of all 2,204 game items filtered to the active category, with `+1x` and `+99x` add buttons and live `IN BAG (✕N)` ownership badges.
- **🗑️ Discard Button:** A red `[✕]` discard button on every row and a `DISCARD (REMOVE)` button in the dossier instantly removes items from the bag (sets quantity to 0 and removes the slot).
- **🎯 Empty Pocket UX:** When a category pocket is empty, the list shows a contextual `+ ADD [CATEGORY] ITEM` shortcut button pointing directly to the catalog modal.
- **🔧 Sort Fix:** Restored missing `P5R_ITEM_SORT_PRIORITY` and `getItemSortRank()` functions that had been accidentally deleted, causing a `ReferenceError` that rendered all item pockets blank.

### v1.0.6 — Standalone Launcher & Audit Hardening
- **🖥️ Audit Hardening & Build Presets:** Compendium safe-unlock, teammate story-locks, and god-tier build ID fixes. The app runs as a native PyWebView (Edge WebView2) window over a bundled stdlib HTTP backend on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- **⚡ God-Tier Build Presets Fixed:** All persona/skill/trait IDs re-verified against the real `data/` tables (Yoshitsune 365→87, Raoul 333→363, Izanagi-no-Okami Picaro 305→366).
- **📖 Compendium Safe Unlock (224/232):** Unlock-all now registers only the 224 bits the game can legitimately set. 8 dead IDs excluded (Metatron, Anat, Prometheus + 5 P5-legacy duplicates).
- **🛡️ Dummy Skill Rejection:** BLANK/placeholder skill IDs (0x0000–0x0009 + named placeholders) filtered from web dropdowns and rejected in persona writes.
- **🚫 Legacy Persona Filter:** Cut-content entries removed from the persona picker.
- **🔒 Teammate Persona Story-Lock:** Backend + UI refuse changing a teammate's persona identity.
- **⚙️ Teammate LV u8 Fix:** Level written/read as a single byte at +0x3C.
- **🧪 94/94 Unit Tests Passing.**

### v1.0.5 — Joker Level / EXP Collision Fix
- **⚡ Joker MC Level / EXP Collision Fix:** Eliminated the legacy `0x3C` money-mirror write. Yen is now written strictly to `0x35C0`.
- **🧪 80/80 Unit Tests Passing.**

### v1.0.4 — Confidant Slot Zeroing
- **🧹 Active Confidant Slot Zeroing:** Setting a Confidant to Rank 0 now completely zeroes all 16 bytes of the slot.

### v1.0.3 — Spoiler Prevention
- **🔒 Spoiler Prevention / Un-Met Confidants:** Un-met confidants remaining at Rank 0 are no longer allocated save slots.
- **⚡ Save Re-signing Stability:** Hardened payload deserialization across all party members, skills, and stock slots.

### v1.0.2
- **💾 Persona Flags Argument Fix:** Fixed an argument mismatch in `set_equipped_persona()` during `/api/save` re-signing.

### v1.0.1
- **⚡ Socket Readiness Polling:** Added active socket polling in `main.py` to eliminate `127.0.0.1` connection refused race conditions.

## 🛠️ Running from Source / Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/j0nnyDiGITAL/change-of-heart.git
cd change-of-heart

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the desktop app
python main.py

# Run the automated test suite
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## 🌐 Hosted Web Build (Vercel)

This fork can also run as an upload/download web app on Vercel:

- Vercel cannot scan your PC's Steam folders, so use **📂 BROWSE...** to upload `DATA.DAT` / `DATA.BIN`.
- Hosted mode processes the uploaded save per request and returns a re-signed download; it does **not** write to disk or keep server-side backups.
- For privacy-sensitive use, prefer local desktop mode; the hosted build necessarily sends the save file to the deployment's serverless function for AES/CRC processing.

Deploy from the fork with:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 🩺 Troubleshooting: app window opens but nothing works
If the editor launches but buttons are dead / saves aren't detected, your **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime** is likely broken (it auto-updates independently of the app and can silently fail after an update):
1. The app now detects this automatically — after ~30 seconds it reopens itself in your default web browser.
2. To fix the native window: Windows Settings → Apps → **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime** → **Modify → Repair**, then relaunch the editor.

## 📜 Important Limitations & Disclaimer

### ⚠️ Confidant Ranks & Romance Notes:
- **Story Cutscenes & Calendar Timeline:** Modifying a Confidant's numerical rank modifies the rank stars and stat benefits in your menu. However, *Persona 5 Royal* tracks dialogue progression and romance choices via a permanent 43,000-bit narrative event matrix tied to specific calendar days.
- **Rolling Back Ranks:** Lowering a Confidant's rank (e.g. from Rank 9 to Rank 8) will **not** replay already-completed story cutscenes if the in-game calendar has moved past that day. To redo branching dialogue choices (such as romance flags), always restore a save or automatic backup from before that hangout took place.

### ⚖️ Trademark Disclaimer:
*Persona 5 Royal* is a registered trademark of ATLUS / SEGA. This tool is a non-commercial, open-source community project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by ATLUS or SEGA. Always keep backups of your save files.
